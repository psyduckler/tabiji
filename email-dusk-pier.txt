FRIDAY, FEB 27 — MISSION DISTRICT
Walk Valencia Street while SF Beer Week is still going (ends Saturday). Dinner at Izakaya Rintaro — a Michelin Bib Gourmand Japanese izakaya in a beautifully restored 1906 earthquake cottage. The handmade noodles and charcoal yakitori are the move. End the night at Trick Dog, one of SF's best cocktail bars, known for its rotating themed menus. 10-minute walk between the two.

SATURDAY, FEB 28 — EMBARCADERO & CHINATOWN
Start at golden hour on the Embarcadero — walk Pier 7 for the skyline view, stop at the Ferry Building. Then head to Chinatown: it's still lit up with Lunar New Year lanterns (the parade is March 7). Pre-dinner cocktails at Moongate Lounge, the intimate bar above Mister Jiu's with views of Waverly Place's red lanterns. Then dinner at Mister Jiu's itself — Michelin-starred, Chinese-Californian, one of the best restaurants in the country.

SUNDAY, MAR 1 — NORTH BEACH
City Lights Bookstore (open until midnight) for a browse, then a drink at Vesuvio Café across the alley — the actual bar where Kerouac drank, unchanged since 1948. Dinner at April Jean on Grant Avenue: tight, well-executed cocktail bar with great food, perfect for solo Sunday dining at the bar. Finish with a walk through Washington Square Park.

MONDAY, MAR 2 — SOMA & FINANCIAL DISTRICT
After work, head to Pacific Cocktail Haven (PCH) — consistently ranked one of the best cocktail bars in the US. The bartenders are world-class without being snobby about it. Then dinner at Bix in Jackson Square: a 1940s jazz supper club in a Gold Street alleyway that has no business being this good in 2026, and yet. End with the Bay Bridge walk along the Embarcadero — the Bay Lights installation is active nightly and worth seeing at least once.

TUESDAY, MAR 3 — HAYES VALLEY
Last evening. Stroll Hayes Street, grab a glass at Biondivino if you feel like it. Then dinner at State Bird Provisions — James Beard Award winner, Michelin-starred, and one of those meals people talk about for years. The dim-sum cart format means every dish arrives announced; the California quail (the state bird) is always on. Nightcap at Absinthe around the corner.
