Here's what's packed into your 4 days (Feb 19-22):

Day 1 - Arrive + Earthships + Rio Grande Gorge Bridge
Start with the Greater World Earthship Community - off-grid homes built from tires and earth that look like they landed from another planet. Then walk across the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge, 650 feet above the river. Round out the evening on the Historic Taos Plaza and grab green chile enchiladas at Orlando's.

Day 2 - Full Day at Taos Ski Valley
February is prime time up there - 305 inches of dry powder per year and a summit at 12,481 feet. Ski the legendary Al's Run and Kachina Peak terrain. Lunch at The Bavarian mid-mountain. Après at the Martini Tree Bar.

Day 3 - Taos Pueblo + Ojo Caliente Hot Springs
Taos Pueblo (UNESCO World Heritage Site) is one of the most moving places in America - people have lived continuously in those adobe buildings for 1,000+ years. In the afternoon, drive 45 minutes south to Ojo Caliente for mineral springs that have been healing people since before the Spanish arrived.

Day 4 - Black Rock Hot Springs + Art + Depart
Free primitive hot springs right in the Rio Grande Gorge (10-minute hike down, no crowds on a Sunday morning). Then the Millicent Rogers Museum - one of the best Native American art collections anywhere - and a walk through the Taos gallery scene before heading home.

The full itinerary has logistics, restaurant picks, budget breakdown, and local tips built in.
