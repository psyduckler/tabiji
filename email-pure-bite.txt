IMPORTANT -- BOOK NOW:
Your dates are Aug 17-22, 2026. The 3-star restaurants (Kashiwaya, Hyotei, Hajime, Koryu) need to be booked 3-6 months in advance. We recommend using Pocket Concierge, TableAll, or your hotel concierge (Ritz-Carlton and Conrad Osaka have the best connections).

The itinerary includes full details on:
- Reservation strategy and timing for each restaurant
- August heat survival tips (it's hot and humid!)
- Budget breakdown (~$4,800-6,800 per person for the full experience)
- Transport between Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe
- Dress codes, payment tips, and dining etiquette

This is going to be an absolutely incredible trip. Osaka is Japan's culinary capital for a reason, and with this lineup of restaurants, your group is going to experience dining at the highest level the country has to offer.
