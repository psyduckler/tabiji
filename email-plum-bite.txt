https://tabiji.ai/i/plum-bite/

13 nights in Tokyo (March 4-17, 2026) -- built for your family with a focus on foodie adventures, relaxation, and kid-friendly fun.

A few highlights:

CHERRY BLOSSOMS
Your trip falls right at the start of cherry blossom season! We've built in blossom-hunting days at Shinjuku Gyoen, Ueno Park, and the famous Meguro River in Nakameguro. By mid-March, early-blooming varieties should be appearing, and you might catch the very start of the main bloom.

UNAGI (EEL) -- AS REQUESTED!
We included three unagi experiences at different price points:
- Unana in Asakusa -- casual, affordable, great for a first taste
- Nodaiwa in Ginza -- historic Edo-period restaurant, legendary eel
- Izuei in Ueno -- beautiful pond-side setting, multi-course options
Plus a quick reference with even more spots (Obana, department store options).

ITALIAN CUISINE -- AS REQUESTED!
Tokyo has an incredible Italian food scene, and we wove it throughout:
- Sempre Pizza -- casual Neapolitan chain, perfect for families
- Ristorante Stefano -- one of the most beloved Italian spots in Tokyo
- La Bisboccia in Hiroo -- rustic, hearty, authentic
- Savoy in Azabu-Juban -- famous for perfect margherita pizza
Plus neighborhood trattorias in Shimokitazawa and beyond.

FAMILY-FRIENDLY ACTIVITIES
TeamLab Planets, Ueno Zoo, Akihabara arcades, Ghibli Museum (book tickets ASAP!), Sunshine Aquarium, Odaiba waterfront, and more.

DAY TRIPS
- Kamakura: Great Buddha, beach town, Enoden coastal train
- Hakone: Pirate ship, volcanic valley, hot springs, maybe Mt. Fuji views

REST DAYS
With 13 nights, we built in two dedicated rest days (Days 5 and 9) so nobody burns out. The pace is relaxed throughout -- no more than 2-3 activities per day.

BUDGET NOTE
The itinerary is designed for mid-range casual dining throughout. For a family of 3-4 over 13 nights, realistic in-Tokyo costs run about $2,000-2,500 (excluding flights). We included tips throughout for keeping costs down.

One important tip: If you want Ghibli Museum tickets, they go on sale the 10th of each month for the following month. Set a reminder -- they sell out within hours!

Have an amazing trip! Tokyo in cherry blossom season with family is truly special.

Warmly,
The tabiji.ai team
