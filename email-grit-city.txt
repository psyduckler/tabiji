Here's what's packed in:

DAY 1 — Oct 22: Old City & Fishtown
Walk Elfreth's Alley (America's oldest continuously inhabited street, built 1702). See the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. Drink at McGillin's Olde Ale House — Philadelphia's oldest bar, open since 1860. Dinner at Angelo's Pizzeria (best cheesesteak AND pizza in South Philly, and yes, they really are that good at both). End the night crawling Fishtown — Frankford Hall beer hall, then Yards Brewing Co.

DAY 2 — Oct 23: Wissahickon Valley Park + Eastern State Penitentiary
This is the day. Morning hike at Wissahickon Valley Park — 1,800 acres of gorge wilderness inside city limits, peak fall foliage in late October. Lunch in Manayunk on the Schuylkill riverfront. Then tonight: Terror Behind the Walls at Eastern State Penitentiary — one of the most intense Halloween experiences in the US, inside a real 190-year-old prison. Book tickets NOW at easternstate.org before they sell out.

DAY 3 — Oct 24: South Philly Deep Dive + Schuylkill Bike Ride
Breakfast at John's Roast Pork (the locals' consensus best cheesesteak — not Pat's, not Geno's). Walk the 9th Street Italian Market. Philadelphia's Magic Gardens — a half-block mosaic labyrinth built over 30 years, genuinely one of the strangest beautiful spaces in America. Rent an Indego bike and ride the Schuylkill Banks Trail through fall color to Boathouse Row (lit up at dusk, reflected in the river). Dinner at Parc on Rittenhouse Square, cocktails at the unmarked Ranstead Room speakeasy.

DAY 4 — Oct 25: Rocky Steps + Art Museum + Reading Terminal
Run the Art Museum steps at sunrise — at 6am alone with the Parkway spread out before you, it's not cheesy, it's electric. Two hours inside the Philadelphia Museum of Art (the armor collection and the Duchamp peephole installation both alone are worth it). Then Reading Terminal Market for your send-off meal: Tommy DiNic's roast pork sandwich, Federal Donuts, Amish sticky buns, and everything else you can carry.
