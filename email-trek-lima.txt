Here's what we built for you:

DAY 1 (June 26) — Arrive in Miraflores
Settle into your base in Miraflores, explore the 1,500-year-old Huaca Pucllana pyramid at dusk, walk the clifftop Malecón over the Pacific, and kick things off with Lima's legendary ceviche at La Mar Cevichería — the iconic seafood spot by Gastón Acurio.

DAY 2 (June 27) — Paragliding + Surf + Barranco
Morning: paraglide off the Miraflores cliffs, 70 meters above the Pacific. Afternoon: surf lesson at La Pampilla beach with wetsuit and board included. Evening: wander Lima's bohemian Barranco neighborhood, cross the famous Puente de los Suspiros (Bridge of Sighs), and have dinner at Isolina Taberna Peruana — home-style Peruvian cooking in a gorgeous old Barranco mansion.

DAY 3 (June 28) — Ballestas Islands & Paracas Reserve
A full-day adventure south of Lima. Boat tour to the Ballestas Islands — sea lions, Humboldt penguins, boobies, and condors circling overhead (Peru's answer to the Galápagos). Then into Paracas National Reserve for flamingos on red-sand beaches and the otherworldly coast where the Atacama meets the Pacific. Lunch: fresh ceviche at the harbor.

DAY 4 (June 29) — Huacachina: Dune Buggies & Sandboarding
Bus to Huacachina — a real oasis in the Peruvian desert, surrounded by 100-meter sand dunes. Afternoon dune buggy session (the drivers are wonderfully unhinged) and sandboarding runs down the face of massive dunes as the sun sets over the desert. Return to Lima by night bus.

DAY 5 (June 30) — Historic Lima, Museo Larco & Magic Fountains
Morning: Lima's UNESCO Historic Center — Plaza Mayor, the 17th-century San Francisco Monastery and its eerie catacombs. Then Museo Larco in Pueblo Libre (45,000 pre-Columbian artifacts, including the surprisingly fascinating erotic pottery gallery). Lunch at Mercado de Surquillo — Lima's best local market. Evening: the Circuito Mágico del Agua — the world's largest fountain complex, lit in 12 colors. Final ceviche at El Muelle in Barranco.
