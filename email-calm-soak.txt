Hi there!

Your personalized Tokyo itinerary is ready and waiting for you:

https://tabiji.ai/i/calm-soak/

We built this specifically for your solo relaxation trip (Feb 27 - Mar 3). Here's what's inside:

- Day-by-day plan with onsen, sento, and hot spring recommendations
- Peaceful gardens and plum blossom spots (late Feb is peak ume season!)
- Quiet neighborhoods like Yanaka and Shimokitazawa
- A tea ceremony experience at Shinjuku Gyoen
- Budget-friendly restaurant picks for solo dining
- Interactive maps for each day
- Realistic budget breakdown (comfortably under $1,000)

The itinerary is designed with a slow, relaxed pace -- only 2-3 activities per day with plenty of breathing room. Tokyo is incredible for solo travelers, and late February is a beautiful time to visit.

A few quick tips:
- Get a Suica/Pasmo IC card at the airport immediately
- Download an eSIM before you fly (Ubigi or Airalo work great)
- Bring cash -- many sento and small restaurants are cash-only
- Pack layers for 5-12C (40-54F) weather

If you have any questions or want adjustments, just reply to this email.

Have an amazing trip!
