Hi Jaime!

THE SHORT VERSION:

We researched every luxury family resort in Corfu specifically for your needs (exceptional food + epic kids club + a 1-year-old), and our #1 pick is Ikos Dassia. Here's why it's perfect for your family:

FOOD: Ikos has 7+ a la carte restaurants with menus designed by Michelin-starred chefs -- all included. Italian, Greek, Asian fusion, French, seafood... every night is a different fine dining experience. They also have a "Dine-Out" program where you can eat at local tavernas on the island, still covered by your all-inclusive. Over 300 premium wines included. It's genuinely the best resort dining we've ever seen.

KIDS CLUB: This is the big one. Ikos Dassia has a "Heroes Creche" that accepts babies from 6 MONTHS old (perfect for your 1-year-old), staffed by OFSTED-qualified caregivers at incredible ratios (1 adult to 3 babies). Your 4 and 6-year-old go to the "Heroes Kids Club" which is FREE and runs all day with games, arts & crafts, sports, and water activities. They even have a "Heroes Supper Club" where the older kids eat dinner together so you can have date nights at the fancy restaurants. Game changer.

We also included two runner-up resorts (MarBella Corfu and Grecotel Corfu Imperial) with pros/cons in the itinerary, so you can compare. But honestly, Ikos is the clear winner for your family.

YOUR ITINERARY (Jun 18-24):

The itinerary is structured around resort life as your home base, with three carefully chosen excursion days:

- Day 1: Arrive and settle in, first pool/beach session, dinner at Ouzo (Greek fine dining)
- Day 2: Full resort day -- kids clubs, spa time for you, date night at Fresco (Italian)
- Day 3: Corfu Old Town adventure -- Venetian fortress, Liston gelato, UNESCO sites
- Day 4: Paleokastritsa day trip -- glass-bottom boat through sea caves, beach taverna lunch
- Day 5: Another resort day -- spa, beach, and the Dine-Out experience at a local taverna
- Day 6: Achilleion Palace (fairy tale palace with Greek mythology statues the kids will love)
- Day 7: Last morning splash and departure

Everything is designed around three young kids: nap times respected, nothing too ambitious, calm beaches, stroller-friendly spots, and a resort base where the hardest decision is which pool to use.

June in Corfu is absolute perfection -- warm but not scorching (28-32C), almost no rain, warm sea, and long sunny evenings until 8:30pm. It's the sweet spot before the August crowds.

The full itinerary has maps, restaurant details, budget breakdowns, baby gear tips, and packing lists. Check it out at the link above!

One tip: Book Ikos ASAP if you haven't already. June family suites go fast.
