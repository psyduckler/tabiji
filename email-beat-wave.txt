Here's what we put together for you:

TRINIDAD (Feb 16-19, 4 nights)
- Carnival Monday: J'ouvert before dawn + Pretty Mas with your band
- Carnival Tuesday: Full costume road march + Las Lap finale
- Beach recovery at Maracas Bay (bake & shark!)
- Doubles, roti, corn soup, and all the Trini street food

RIO DE JANEIRO (Feb 20-27, 7 nights)
- Champion's Parade at the Sambadrome (Sat Feb 21)
- Late-season blocos in Centro and Santa Teresa
- Cristo Redentor, Sugarloaf, Tijuca Forest hike
- Full beach days at Ipanema and Copacabana
- Niteroi day trip for Niemeyer's UFO museum
- Lapa samba nights, Botafogo cocktails, farewell feast

Your trip lands perfectly during Carnival season in BOTH countries -- Trinidad Carnival is Feb 16-17 and Rio's Champion's Parade is Feb 21. We structured it so you hit Trinidad first for the main Carnival days, then fly to Rio for the afterglow and a full week of beaches, culture, and nightlife.

Solo travel tips, safety advice, budget breakdowns, and specific restaurant recommendations are all in the itinerary.

A few things to book ASAP:
1. Mas band registration (TRIBE, Bliss, or Lost Tribe) for Trinidad Carnival
2. Sambadrome Champion's Parade tickets for Feb 21
3. Corcovado train tickets (sells out)
4. Your POS to GIG flight for Feb 19
