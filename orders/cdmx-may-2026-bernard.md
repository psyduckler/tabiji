## 🌤 Weather & Packing for Late May

May marks the very beginning of CDMX's rainy season — but don't worry. Days are warm and sunny (highs around **27°C / 80°F**), with brief afternoon showers that usually clear by evening. Nights cool down to **11°C / 52°F**, so you'll want a light layer.

**Pack:**
- 🌞 Light, breathable clothing (linen is your friend)
- 🧥 A light jacket or sweater for evenings
- ☔ A compact umbrella or packable rain jacket (afternoon showers)
- 👟 Comfortable walking shoes (Roma & Condesa are made for strolling)
- 👗 One nice outfit for fine dining (smart casual — no shorts/flip-flops at Pujol or Quintonil)
- 🧴 SPF 50 sunscreen (altitude = stronger sun)
- 💊 Pepto-Bismol (just in case — the street food is incredible but your stomach may need a day to adjust)

## 🏘 Neighborhood Guide

### Roma Norte & Condesa
Your home base for the first half. Tree-lined streets, art deco architecture, independent coffee shops on every corner, and some of the best restaurants in the Western Hemisphere. Roma is slightly grittier and more vibrant; Condesa is leafier and calmer. Both are extremely walkable and sit right next to each other.

> *"I'm really into the vibe of the cities I visit, and the vibe of Mexico City was unlike anywhere else. We spent half our trip in Condesa and the other half in Roma Norte."* — u/macsaeki, r/MexicoCity ([trip report](https://www.reddit.com/r/MexicoCity/comments/1nzw1zd/))

### Polanco
CDMX's upscale neighborhood — think tree-lined Avenida Presidente Masaryk, world-class museums (Soumaya, Jumex), luxury boutiques, and some of the city's finest restaurants including Pujol and Quintonil. Quieter, more polished, perfect for your last couple of days.

### Centro Histórico
The beating heart of the city. The Zócalo, Palacio de Bellas Artes, Templo Mayor, murals by Diego Rivera. Visit for a morning — it's intense but unforgettable.

### Coyoacán
The bohemian south. Frida Kahlo's Blue House, a gorgeous central market, and a village-within-a-city feel. Worth a half-day.

## 🚗 Getting Around

**Uber** is your best friend in CDMX — it's safe, reliable, and absurdly cheap (most rides within the tourist corridor are $2–5 USD).

> *"It's easy to get around via walking, metro, and Uber is inexpensive compared to the US."* — u/mugenrice, r/MexicoCity

**Also consider:**
- **Walking** — Roma, Condesa, and Polanco are extremely walkable
- **Metro** — Clean, efficient, $0.25 USD per ride. Great for Centro Histórico
- **Cablebús Line 3** — A hidden gem! Soar over Chapultepec Park for just 7 pesos ($0.40 USD). *"Only 7 pesos and you get to soar over the city, parallel to Chapultepec Park."* — u/ottermagical
- **Airport transfers** — Book a Sitio taxi at the airport kiosk (~$15–20 USD to Roma/Condesa), or use Uber from the rideshare pickup area

**Pro tip:** Download the Uber app, Google Maps offline for CDMX, and WhatsApp (essential for restaurant reservations in Mexico).

## 🔑 Insider Tips from Reddit

1. **Book fine dining early.** Pujol needs 2–3 months advance. Quintonil and Contramar need at least 2–3 weeks. Use WhatsApp for last-minute availability — it's how locals do it

2. **Don't overplan.** The best CDMX moments happen when you wander. *"Go on a walk in any direction. Get hungry. Look for a taco stand with exactly one empty stool. Sit down. Ask the proprietor what you should have. Order two."* — u/-SkarchieBonkers-, r/MexicoCity

3. **Street food is safe** — look for stands with high turnover and local crowds. The food is constantly being freshly prepared

4. **Altitude matters.** At 7,350 feet, you'll feel it the first day or two. Drink extra water, go easy on alcohol the first night, and take it slow

5. **Hydrate obsessively.** Buy large bottles of water everywhere. Don't drink tap water

6. **Tipping:** 15–20% at sit-down restaurants, 10–15% at casual spots. Round up for Uber drivers

7. **Cash vs. card:** Most restaurants take cards, but carry some pesos for street food, markets, and tips. ATMs in convenience stores (Oxxo) work well

8. **Safety:** Roma, Condesa, Polanco, and Centro Histórico (daytime) are very safe for tourists. Use normal big-city awareness. Uber over street taxis at night

9. **Learn three phrases:** *"La cuenta, por favor"* (the check), *"Sin picante"* (no spice), and *"Otra vez, por favor"* (one more, please — you'll use this at taco stands)

10. **Xochimilco** is amazing if you have extra time — rent a *trajinera* (colorful boat) with your own snacks and drinks and float through ancient canals. *"It's the only place in the world where axolotls are naturally found."* — u/Wonderful-Watch5155
