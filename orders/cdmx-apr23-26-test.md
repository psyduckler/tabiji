# 🇲🇽 Mexico City — April 23–26, 2026

**Your personalized tabiji itinerary**
*4 days / 3 nights · 2 travelers · Adventure + Relaxation*

---

Hey there! 👋

You picked one of the best times to visit CDMX. Late April is the tail end of dry season — expect sunny skies, highs around 26–28°C (79–82°F), and the occasional brief afternoon shower as rainy season teases its arrival. The city is alive, the jacarandas may still have some purple blooms, and you'll beat the summer crowds.

This itinerary clusters activities by neighborhood so you're not crisscrossing the city in traffic. We've mixed in ruins, markets, and active exploration with spa time, rooftop mezcal, and long café mornings — because that's the CDMX sweet spot.

**Getting around:** Uber works perfectly and is cheap (most rides $40–80 MXN / $2–4 USD). Metro is safe and efficient ($5 MXN) but skip it during rush hour. Download the Uber app before you land.

*Adventure day — ancient pyramids in the morning, reward yourself at night*

#### 🌅 Early Morning (6:30 AM) — Depart for Teotihuacán
- **How to get there:** Book a private driver through your hotel or take an Uber to **Terminal de Autobuses del Norte** (Uber ~$80 MXN from Roma/Condesa). Take the Autobuses Teotihuacán bus — they leave every 15 min, ~$104 MXN round trip, 1-hour ride.
- **Arrive by 8:00 AM** — beat the heat and the tour buses.

> 💡 **Insider tip:** As of 2024, you CAN climb the Pyramid of the Sun and Moon again. Go to the Moon pyramid first (smaller, steeper, better panoramic view of the entire Avenue of the Dead). Most tourists beeline for the Sun — you'll have Moon to yourselves early.

- **Entry:** ~$95 MXN per person

📍 Inside a cave, 200m from Gate 5 of Teotihuacán
- **Order:** Sopa azteca (tortilla soup), nopales salad, lamb barbacoa
- **Price:** ~$300–400 MXN per person
- **Why:** It's literally inside a cave next to the pyramids. Touristy? A little. Worth it for the atmosphere? Absolutely. Live music sometimes plays and the acoustics in the cave are magical.
- ⏱️ *1.5 hours*

#### 😌 Afternoon (3:30 PM) — Rest & Recharge
Head back to the city (~1 hour). Shower, nap, decompress. You earned it.

**Dinner: Máximo Bistrot**
📍 Tonalá 133, Roma Norte

- ⏱️ *2 hours*

- **Entry:** ~$270 MXN (foreigners)
- ⏱️ *1–1.5 hours*

- **Price:** ~$80–150 MXN per person

- ⏱️ *1.5–2 hours*

#### 🌆 Evening (8:00 PM) — Condesa Dinner & Drinks

**Dinner: Contramar** (or its sister spot **Entremar** if Contramar is booked)
📍 Durango 200, Roma Norte (Contramar) / Enrique Rebsamen 388 (Entremar)
- **Order:** The red-and-green grilled whole fish (the signature dish — half parsley, half chili), tuna tostadas, and a michelada
- **Price:** ~$500–700 MXN per person
- **Why:** Contramar is THE seafood spot in CDMX. Loud, vibrant, incredible fish. If you can only do one "scene" restaurant, this is it.

> ⚠️ **Contramar is lunch-only (closes ~6:30 PM).** If you want it, swap it to Day 3 lunch and move Mercado de Coyoacán to a snack. Alternatively, Entremar is open for dinner and serves the same menu.

## 🧳 Packing & Practical Tips

- **☀️ Sun protection is non-negotiable.** CDMX is at 2,240m altitude — you burn faster than you think, even when it doesn't feel hot. SPF 50, hat, sunglasses.
- **🌧️ Pack a light rain shell.** Late April can bring brief afternoon showers (15–30 min). Don't let it change your plans — just duck into a café.
- **💧 Don't drink tap water.** Bottled or filtered only. Ice at restaurants is almost always purified (made from purified water) — you're fine.
- **💵 Cash is king** for street food, markets, tips, and small shops. ATMs in Condesa/Roma are safe — use bank ATMs inside branches, not standalone ones. Withdraw in MXN (decline the conversion).
- **📱 Get an eSIM** (Airalo or Holafly) before you land — way cheaper than roaming.
- **🚕 Uber > street taxis.** Always. Especially at night and from the airport.
- **🗣️ Learn 5 phrases:** "La cuenta, por favor" (the check), "Sin picante" (no spice), "¿Qué me recomienda?" (what do you recommend?), "Está delicioso" (it's delicious), "Gracias, muy amable" (thanks, very kind).
- **💊 Bring Pepto or Imodium** just in case. Street food is incredible but your stomach may need a day to adjust. Start with cooked-to-order stalls (like tacos), not raw salads from unknown sources.
