4 days in Taos, NM — Feb 19-22, solo adventure.

Here's what we've planned for you:

Day 1 - Arrive & Feel the Taos Vibe
Drive in through the Rio Grande Canyon and arrive into one of the Southwest's most layered, creative towns. Walk Taos Historic Plaza, hit the Harwood Museum of Art, then drive 4 miles south to see the San Francisco de Asis Mission Church — the same one Georgia O'Keeffe and Ansel Adams obsessed over. Dinner at Love Apple (farm-to-table in a converted adobe chapel — no reservations, show up right at 5pm). End the night at the Adobe Bar at Taos Inn where the kiva fireplace burns all winter and live music plays Thursday through Sunday.

Day 2 - Taos Ski Valley
February is peak powder season. Drive 19 miles up into the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to Taos Ski Valley — a mountain with a cult following among serious skiers for its steep terrain and legendary snow. Hit Kachina Peak for the best ridgeline views and the classic runs off the summit. Lunch at The Bavarian (a transplanted German alpine restaurant at 10,200 ft — bratwurst and schnitzel in the New Mexico mountains, fully surreal and worth it). Apres-ski at the Martini Tree Bar, then back to town for a green chile cheeseburger at Alley Cantina — the oldest commercial building in Taos, now a beloved local bar.

Day 3 - Pueblo, Gorge & Earthships
Morning at Taos Pueblo — a UNESCO World Heritage Site where people have lived continuously for 1,000 years in the same multi-story adobe buildings. This is a living community, not a museum: around 150 tribal members still live here without electricity or running water, by choice. Take the guided tour, browse the artisan shops, buy something directly from the maker. Lunch at Ranchos Plaza Grill (locals' top pick for Northern NM cooking — order Christmas chile, meaning both red and green). Then drive west to the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge: 650 feet above the river, with a 6-mile rim trail where the silence is total and the sky is everything. Late afternoon at the Greater World Earthship Community for a guided tour — off-grid homes built from tires, aluminum cans, and glass bottles, completely solar powered, with indoor winter greenhouses. One of the most mind-bending architectural experiences in America. Dinner at Medley.

Day 4 - Ojo Caliente & Departure
Final morning at Michael's Kitchen for legendary green chile breakfast burritos (open since 1974, the quintessential Taos diner). Then drive 30 minutes south to Ojo Caliente Mineral Springs — four distinct mineral pools (iron, lithia, arsenic, soda), each with different compositions and temperatures, used for healing for thousands of years. Soak for 2-3 hours with steam rising around you and the Jemez Mountains in the distance. Then head south to Albuquerque for your flight home. The lithia spring water is drinkable from a fountain — try a glass. It tastes strange and is absolutely worth it.
