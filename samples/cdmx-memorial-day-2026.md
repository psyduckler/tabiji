## 🗓 Day 1 — Friday, May 22
### *Roma Norte & Centro Histórico*

#### ☀️ Morning

**Breakfast: Chilpa**
📍 Roma Norte · 💰 $8–15 pp

Traditional Mexican breakfast done perfectly. Their chilaquiles and huevos rancheros are show-stoppers.

> *"Flat out amazing with everything we ordered. Generous portions."* — Redditor who rated it 9/10 across 9 days of CDMX eating

🔑 **Pro tip:** Go before 10am to avoid weekend crowds. Order the Mexican-style breakfast plates — that's where they shine.

**Morning Activity: Walk Roma Norte**
Start with a stroll through Roma Norte's tree-lined streets. Explore the art deco architecture, pop into independent bookshops and galleries along Álvaro Obregón and Orizaba. Stop at Jardín Pushkin for coffee in one of the small specialty cafés.

---

#### 🌤 Midday

**Lunch: El Cardenal (Centro Histórico)**
📍 Centro Histórico · 💰 $20–35 pp

Traditional Mexican cuisine executed at an extraordinary level. Their mole is legendary, and the escamoles (ant larvae — yes, try them) are a true Mexico City experience.

> *"Traditional Mexican cuisine executed at a high level. The mole was fantastic."* — Redditor, 9/10 rating

🔑 **Pro tip:** Go to the Centro Histórico location for the full experience. Pair with a mezcal flight. Portions aren't huge — don't hesitate to order generously.

**Afternoon Activity: Centro Histórico Walking Tour**
- **Palacio de Bellas Artes** — Jaw-dropping Art Nouveau exterior, murals by Diego Rivera and Siqueiros inside (entry ~$4)
- **Templo Mayor** — Aztec ruins right in the heart of the city
- **Zócalo** — One of the largest public squares in the world
- **Palacio Nacional** — Free entry, Rivera's epic murals depicting Mexican history

---

#### 🌙 Evening

**Dinner: Quintonil ★★** *(Michelin 2-star)*
📍 Polanco · 💰 $150–200 pp (tasting menu with wine pairing)

Chef Jorge Vallejo's tasting menu is a love letter to Mexican biodiversity. Expect 10+ courses featuring ingredients you've never heard of — hoja santa, chepil, chapulines — transformed into something transcendent.

> *"Maybe I'm biased for fine dining but Quintonil really blew my mind with the creativity and boldness of the food. Must try."* — Redditor who rated it a perfect 10/10

🔑 **Pro tip:** Book 6–8 weeks in advance. Request the chef's counter if available — it's a completely different experience. Ask for the wine pairing featuring Mexican wines. The herb garden on the terrace is where they grow ingredients used that evening.

**After Dinner:** Walk through Polanco's upscale streets. Stop at Hanky Panky (speakeasy, reservations required) for one of the best cocktail bars in Latin America.

---

## 🗓 Day 2 — Saturday, May 23
### *Condesa, Roma & Polanco*

#### ☀️ Morning

**Breakfast: Panadería Rosetta**
📍 Roma Norte · 💰 $8–12 pp

Elena Reygadas' legendary bakery. The guava and cheese croissant and the rosemary bun (*pan de romero*) are iconic.

> *"The pastries were great"* — universally cited across 100+ Reddit threads as a CDMX must-visit

🔑 **Pro tip:** Arrive by 8:30am on weekends — they sell out of signature items. Careful: staff gives you separate bags for hot and cold items without telling you there's another bag coming. Don't walk out with half your order!

**Morning Activity: Museo Nacional de Antropología**
The single best museum in the Americas. The Aztec Sun Stone, Mayan galleries, and Olmec heads will leave you speechless. Budget 2–3 hours minimum.

💰 Entry: ~$5 · 📍 Chapultepec Park

---

#### 🌤 Midday

**Lunch: Contramar**
📍 Roma Norte · 💰 $30–50 pp

The iconic tuna tostadas and the red-and-green grilled whole fish (*pescado a la talla*) are non-negotiable. This is the quintessential Mexico City lunch experience.

> *"Tuna tostadas = life-changing, loved by almost everyone"* — Aggregated from 100+ Reddit mentions

🔑 **Pro tip:** Book via their website 2–3 weeks ahead for Saturday lunch (their busiest service). Go at 1pm — the room is buzzing. Skip the apps and save room for the fish. If you can't get a reservation, try **Entremar** (same owners, same quality, easier to book — *"whole fish was incredible"*).

**Afternoon Activity: Condesa & Parque México**
Walk off lunch through La Condesa — Mexico City's most walkable, leafy neighborhood. Stroll Parque México, grab a craft mezcal at Baltra Bar, browse the boutiques on Amsterdam and Michoacán.

---

#### 🌙 Evening

**Dinner: Pujol ★★** *(Michelin 2-star, World's #4 Restaurant)*
📍 Polanco · 💰 $180–250 pp (tasting menu with pairing)

Choose between two experiences: the **traditional tasting menu** (featuring the legendary *mole madre* — a mole aged 2,500+ days layered with a fresh mole) or the **Taco Omakase** (12-course taco journey). For a couple, one of each is perfect.

> *"Absolute must. Famous mole madre."* — Consistently the #1 mentioned fine dining restaurant across all CDMX Reddit threads

🔑 **Pro tip:** Book 2–3 months ahead. The Taco Omakase is lunch only (request this for a future trip if unavailable at dinner). The mole madre alone is worth the trip — 2,500 days of layered history in a single dish. Dress smart casual.

**After Dinner:** Stroll through Polanco's Presidente Masaryk avenue (Mexico City's Champs-Élysées). End at Licorería Limantour for a nightcap — one of the World's 50 Best Bars.

---

## 🗓 Day 3 — Sunday, May 24
### *Coyoacán, Xochimilco & Roma*

#### ☀️ Morning

**Breakfast: Mercado de Coyoacán**
📍 Coyoacán · 💰 $5–10 pp

Start in the market with *tostadas de tinga*, fresh juices, and tamales from the vendors. This is the real Mexico City breakfast.

🔑 **Pro tip:** Go early (9am) before tourist crowds. Wander the stalls, try whatever looks good — point and smile works perfectly.

**Morning Activity: Coyoacán & Museo Frida Kahlo (Casa Azul)**
The Blue House is intimate and moving — Frida's paintings, her garden, her wheelchair, her bed with the mirror above it. Book tickets online in advance (they sell out).

Then walk the cobblestone streets of Coyoacán's centro — it feels like a colonial village within the megacity. Stop at Jardín Centenario for street elote and esquites.

💰 Casa Azul: ~$13 · ⏰ Book online at museofridakahlo.org.mx — **sells out weeks ahead**

---

#### 🌤 Midday

**Lunch: Street Tacos — El Vilsito → Orinoco → El Califa de León**
📍 Various / Roma-Condesa corridor · 💰 $3–8 pp

Today is your street taco crawl. Hit 2–3 spots:

- **El Vilsito** (Narvarte) — A mechanic shop by day, legendary taco stand by night. But the daytime tacos are elite too. *Al pastor* is the move.
- **Orinoco** (Roma Norte) — Reliable, crowd-pleasing. *Al pastor with orange salsa* 🔥
- **El Califa de León** (Multiple locations) — Michelin-starred taco stand. Yes, really. A single taco that earned a star. Get the *bistec* or *costilla*.

> *"El Califa de León: considered among the best by locals + tourists"* — Reddit consensus

🔑 **Pro tip:** Eat at the counter, order 2–3 tacos per spot, don't fill up at one place. This is a crawl. Budget 3 spots in 2 hours.

**Afternoon Activity: Xochimilco Trajineras**
Hire a colorful *trajinera* (flat-bottomed boat) through the ancient Aztec canals. Buy food and drinks from floating vendors. This is touristy and also genuinely magical — the canals are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the last remnant of the lake system that once covered the entire valley.

💰 ~$25–30 per boat/hour (seats 15, so just you two = cozy). Negotiate.

🔑 **Pro tip:** Go to **Embarcadero Cuemanco** (less crowded than Nativitas). A Sunday afternoon is perfect — festive atmosphere with mariachis floating by. Uber there, ~30 min from Roma.

---

#### 🌙 Evening

**Dinner: Máximo Bistrot** *(Michelin 1-star)*
📍 Roma Norte · 💰 $80–120 pp (tasting menu ~$175 MXN/~$3,500 MXN pp)

Chef Eduardo "Lalo" García's market-driven restaurant. The menu changes daily based on what's best at the market that morning. French technique, Mexican soul. The tasting menu begins with a trio of snacks and builds through 8+ courses.

> *"Blew Pujol out of the water" — Multiple Redditors rank this above the 2-star restaurants for pure flavor*

🔑 **Pro tip:** Book 3–4 weeks ahead. Lunch is easier to get than dinner. If you can only do one "under the radar" fine dining spot, this is it. The daily-changing menu means every visit is unique.

**After Dinner:** Walk home through Roma Norte's buzzing Saturday-night streets. Stop at Departamento for natural wine, or grab a late-night churro at **El Moro** (open late, *"touristy but worth it"*).

---

## 🗓 Day 4 — Monday, May 25 (Memorial Day)
### *Brunch, Polanco & Farewell*

#### ☀️ Morning

**Brunch: Café Nin**
📍 Roma Norte · 💰 $15–25 pp

From the owners of Rosetta — a gorgeous, airy brunch spot. Excellent egg dishes, house-baked bread, and some of the best coffee in the city.

🔑 **Pro tip:** Reservations recommended for weekend brunch. The ricotta hotcakes are legendary.

**Morning Activity: Soumaya & Jumex Museums (Polanco)**
Two world-class museums, side by side, both **free**.

- **Museo Soumaya** — Carlos Slim's private collection in a stunning silver building. Rodin sculptures, European masters, Mexican art.
- **Museo Jumex** — Contemporary art in a David Chipperfield–designed building. Rotating exhibitions.

---

#### 🌤 Midday

**Lunch: Campobaja**
📍 Roma Norte · 💰 $25–40 pp

Baja-style seafood in a vibrant, casual setting. The octopus and blue shrimp tostada are both exceptional.

> *"Best pulpo ever. Solid vibes."* — Reddit favorite · *"Amazing seafood — the pulpo might have been the best I've ever tasted"* — 9/10 Redditor review

🔑 **Pro tip:** No reservations, first-come-first-served. Arrive by 1:30pm. Pair everything with a michelada or cold cerveza.

**Afternoon Activity: Chapultepec Castle**
One of only two royal castles in the Americas. Stunning views over the entire city, gorgeous murals, and the history of Mexico from Aztecs to revolution. A perfect send-off.

💰 Entry: ~$5 · ⏰ Allow 1.5 hours

---

#### 🌙 Evening

**Dinner: Em** *(Michelin 1-star)*
📍 Polanco · 💰 $100–150 pp (8-course tasting menu)

Your farewell dinner. Chef Lucho Martínez (mentored by Lalo García of Máximo) serves elevated Mexican cuisine — Caesar salad tostada with lobster, pork rib tamale with black mole, and surprises throughout.

> *"My favorite from the bunch is EM's tasting menu"* — CDMX local who's been 20+ times (r/finedining)

🔑 **Pro tip:** Book 2–3 weeks ahead. The tasting menu lets the chef show off — trust it completely. Don't miss the cocktail program.

**Farewell:** End the night with a mezcal at **Bósforo** (Centro) or **Pare de Sufrir** (Roma) — both beloved local bars with incredible mezcal selections.

---

## 🚗 Getting Around

### Airport → City
- **Uber/DiDi:** ~$15–25 USD to Roma/Condesa (30–60 min depending on traffic). The easiest option.
- **Official airport taxi:** Prepaid at booths inside the terminal. Slightly more expensive but safe and reliable.
- **Metro:** Line 5 from Terminal Aérea. Cheap ($0.25) but not practical with luggage.
- ⚠️ **Avoid:** Unofficial taxis outside the terminal.

### Daily Transport
- **Uber/DiDi:** Works everywhere, extremely affordable ($3–8 for most rides). Your primary transport.
- **Metro:** Clean, safe during daytime, incredibly cheap. Great for Centro Histórico. Avoid rush hour with bags.
- **Walking:** Roma, Condesa, and Polanco are very walkable. Most of your daytime exploration will be on foot.
- **Turibus:** Hop-on-hop-off if you want an overview on Day 1 (skip if you prefer deeper exploration).

🔑 **Pro tip from Reddit:** *"Download DiDi as a backup to Uber. Sometimes one has better prices/availability than the other. Both work great."*

## 🏘 Neighborhood Guide

### Roma Norte ★★★★★
*Where to stay.* Tree-lined streets, art deco buildings, the city's best restaurant density. Walkable to Condesa. Young, creative, buzzing at night. This is your home base.

### La Condesa ★★★★★
*Roma's leafy sister.* Parque México, Amsterdam circle, sidewalk cafés. More residential, slightly more upscale. Perfect for afternoon strolls.

### Polanco ★★★★☆
*Mexico City's Upper East Side.* Where the fine dining lives (Pujol, Quintonil, Em). Museums, luxury shopping, manicured streets. Beautiful but less "real."

### Centro Histórico ★★★★☆
*The ancient heart.* Zócalo, Palacio de Bellas Artes, Templo Mayor. Gritty, chaotic, magnificent. Essential for a day visit. Stay in Roma and Uber/Metro over.

### Coyoacán ★★★★☆
*The bohemian village.* Frida Kahlo's Blue House, cobblestone plazas, the best market. Feels like a different city. Worth a full morning.

## 🌦 Weather & Packing — May

May is the **start of rainy season**, but don't worry — it's predictable:
- ☀️ **Mornings:** Sunny, warm, 70–80°F (21–27°C)
- 🌧 **Afternoons:** Brief, heavy rain showers (usually 4–6pm, lasting 30–60 min)
- 🌙 **Evenings:** Cool and pleasant, 55–65°F (13–18°C)

### Pack:
- ☔ Compact umbrella or light rain jacket (essential)
- 👟 Comfortable walking shoes (cobblestones everywhere)
- 👗 Smart casual outfits for fine dining (no shorts/flip-flops at Pujol/Quintonil)
- 🧴 Sunscreen + hat (altitude = stronger UV — CDMX is at 7,350 ft)
- 💊 Pepto-Bismol / Imodium (just in case — *"better to have it and not need it"*)
- 🔌 No adapter needed — Mexico uses same plugs as the US

## 🔐 Safety Tips

> *Sourced from dozens of Reddit trip reports and local advice*

1. **Roma, Condesa, Polanco, and Coyoacán are very safe** — comparable to any major US city. Walk freely during the day, use common sense at night.

2. **Uber/DiDi everywhere after dark.** Don't hail street taxis, especially at night.

3. **Avoid flashing expensive jewelry/watches.** Dress down slightly — you'll blend in better and feel more comfortable.

4. **ATMs: Use bank ATMs inside branches** (Santander, BBVA, Banorte). Avoid standalone street ATMs. Withdraw pesos — you'll get better rates than exchanging cash.

5. **Water:** Don't drink tap water. Bottled water everywhere. Ice in restaurants is purified (made from *agua purificada*) — it's safe.

6. **Stomach prep:** Start with cooked street food before raw items. Some Redditors recommend starting Pepto-Bismol the day before arrival as a preventative.

7. **Altitude:** CDMX is at 7,350 feet. You may feel slightly winded the first day. Hydrate aggressively. Go easy on alcohol Day 1.

8. **Earthquake alerts:** You may hear the *alerta sísmica* (earthquake alarm) during your stay. Follow locals — they're very practiced. It's usually precautionary.

9. **Scams to avoid:** Fake police asking for your passport (real police won't), "broken" taxi meters, overpriced airport transfers from unofficial booths.

10. **Best Reddit advice:** *"Mexico City is safer than most people think and more dangerous than most people who live there admit. Use the same awareness you'd use in Chicago or LA and you'll be absolutely fine."*

## 💡 Insider Tips

*Sourced from real Reddit trip reports:*

🌮 **"The best meal I had in Mexico City cost $2."** Don't skip street food for fine dining every meal. The contrast is what makes CDMX special.

📱 **Get a local SIM** at the airport (Telcel is most reliable). Data is cheap (~$10 for a week) and you'll need it for Uber/Google Maps.

🗣 **Learn basic Spanish.** Menus at street stalls are rarely in English. *"Un taco de pastor, por favor"* goes a long way. Google Translate camera mode is your friend.

⏰ **Mexican dining times are later.** Lunch is 2–4pm, dinner is 8–10pm. Restaurants are empty at noon and 6pm — if you see a crowd at 3pm, that's normal.

💳 **Cash is king for street food.** Carry small bills (20s and 50s MXN). Fine dining restaurants accept cards.

🫗 **Mezcal > Tequila in CDMX.** The mezcal scene is incredible. Ask for *mezcal joven* (unaged) with orange slices and sal de gusano (worm salt). Trust us.

🏃 **Book a food tour on Day 1.** Club Tengo Hambre and Eat Mexico are frequently recommended on Reddit for deep-dive taco tours that hit spots you'd never find alone.

🚰 **Hydrate.** The altitude + walking + spicy food = dehydration. Carry a water bottle. Electrolyte packets (Liquid IV) are worth packing.
