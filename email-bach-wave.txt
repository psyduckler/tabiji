Hey Rebecca! 🎉

YOUR BACHELORETTE ITINERARY IS READY AND WE ARE SO EXCITED FOR YOU!

9 nights in Nosara, Costa Rica with your crew -- this is going to be absolutely EPIC. We're talking surf lessons on white sand beaches, a sunset catamaran cruise along the Pacific coast, horseback riding through the jungle, spa days, incredible group dinners on cliffside terraces, and enough golden-hour photos to fill an entire album.

Here's your custom itinerary:

A few highlights from your trip (Feb 19-28):

- DAY 1: Welcome dinner at La Luna -- sunset cliffside restaurant that will set the tone for the whole trip
- DAY 2: Group surf lesson at Playa Guiones -- THE iconic bachelorette activity
- DAY 3: Spa & pool recovery day -- because pacing is everything on a 9-night trip!
- DAY 4: Horseback riding through the jungle + first big night out at Kaya Sol
- DAY 5: Yoga at Bodhi Tree + private chef dinner at the villa
- DAY 6: SUNSET CATAMARAN CRUISE -- open bar, snorkeling, the works. THE core memory.
- DAY 7: ATV jungle adventure to a hidden waterfall
- DAY 8: Costa Rican cooking class + last night out
- DAY 9: Tide pools, golden hour photos, farewell dinner at La Luna (full circle!)
- DAY 10: Sandy feet, full hearts, departure

We paced it with high-energy adventure days mixed with chill recovery days so nobody burns out. February is peak dry season -- sunny every day, warm ocean, zero rain. You hit the jackpot with these dates!

PRO TIPS WE INCLUDED:
- Villa recommendations (way better than hotels for a bach group!)
- Matching outfit photo op spots
- Private chef options for villa dinners
- Budget breakdown for easy group splitting
- All the practical stuff (4x4 rentals, cash tips, WhatsApp booking)
