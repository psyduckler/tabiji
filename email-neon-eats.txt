You're visiting Miami Feb 20–22, and you've accidentally picked the most perfectly timed weekend possible: the South Beach Wine & Food Festival (SOBEWFF) turns 25 this year. Over 105 events, hundreds of celebrity chefs, and the legendary Grand Tasting Village — held right on the sand — runs Saturday and Sunday while you're there. Book tickets at sobewff.org now, they sell out.

Here's your weekend:

FRIDAY, FEB 20 — Arrive + Wynwood + Little Havana + Le Jardinier

Start in Wynwood: the open-air art district where every warehouse wall is a mural. Walk the Wynwood Walls, grab a pastry and espresso at Zak the Baker, then wander the side streets where the best murals live. Give it 90 minutes.

Then Uber to Little Havana for late afternoon. Walk Calle Ocho (SW 8th Street) — cigar shops, fruit stands, the smell of Cuban coffee everywhere. Stop at Ball & Chain (1513 SW 8th St) for a mojito and live salsa music in the garden. Get a cortadito and a guava pastelito from the Versailles walk-up window. Walk Domino Park. Feel the city.

Dinner: Le Jardinier (61 NE 41st St, Design District) — a Michelin-recognized French restaurant inside the ICA Miami building. Chef Alain Verzeroli's seasonal, vegetable-forward cuisine is as beautiful to look at as it is to eat. One of the most stunning dining rooms in Miami. Reserve on Resy immediately — SOBEWFF weekend fills these tables fast.

Estimated dinner: $120–180/pp with wine.

SATURDAY, FEB 21 — Art Deco + SOBEWFF Grand Tasting Village + Stubborn Seed

Morning: breakfast at News Cafe (800 Ocean Dr) on the terrace — Cuban toast, strong coffee, Ocean Drive waking up. Then the Art Deco walking tour from the Welcome Center at 10:30am ($30/pp) — the highest concentration of Art Deco architecture in the world, and a guide who makes you see it completely differently.

Afternoon: SOBEWFF Grand Tasting Village on the South Beach sand. This is the main event. 150+ chefs and food producers, unlimited tastings, wine and spirits pours, live culinary demos. Arrive when it opens, hit the spirit tents first (pours are most generous early), eat small amounts of many things, and stay curious. This is what you came for.

Also check: Burger Bash hosted by Rachael Ray (Saturday evening, separate ticket) — one of SOBEWFF's most beloved events.

Dinner: Stubborn Seed (1228 Washington Ave, South Beach) — Miami Beach's Michelin-starred restaurant by Top Chef winner Jeremy Ford. The tasting menu is the move: local Florida produce, Gulf seafood, precise innovative technique. Dark, intimate, 50 seats, kitchen visible behind glass. Wine pairing recommended. This is the dinner of the weekend.

Reserve immediately on Resy. If you can't get in, try Hoja (contemporary Latin, 2 Michelin stars) or Ariete by Michael Beltran in Coconut Grove.

Estimated dinner: $155–240/pp with pairing.

SUNDAY, FEB 22 — Little Havana Brunch + Vizcaya + SOBEWFF Final Day + COTE Miami

Morning: Versailles Restaurant (3555 SW 8th St) for a proper Cuban breakfast — eggs with chorizo criollo, pan cubano, ripe plantains, café con leche. Open since 1971. This is the neighborhood's living room.

After breakfast: walk Calle Ocho at your own pace. Watch the cigar rollers at El Titan de Bronze (1071 SW 8th St). Browse Cuba Ocho gallery. Take your time.

Midday: Vizcaya Museum & Gardens (3251 S Miami Ave, Coconut Grove, $22/pp). A 1916 Italian Renaissance villa on Biscayne Bay with 10 acres of formal gardens. In February, everything is in bloom — bougainvillea, gardenias, the bay glittering through the stone balustrades. Allow 90 minutes. This is the quiet gem of the weekend.

Afternoon: one final lap of the SOBEWFF Grand Tasting Village (Sunday session). Sunday has a more relaxed energy — chefs in good moods at the end of a big weekend, often more generous. Hit what you missed yesterday.

Dinner: COTE Miami (3900 NE 2nd Ave, Design District) — Michelin-recognized Korean steakhouse. USDA Prime and Wagyu beef grilled tableside over charcoal, extraordinary banchan, one of Miami's best wine lists. Order the Butcher's Feast ($75/pp): four cuts, unlimited banchan, egg soufflé. This is the most fun fine dining in Miami — theatrical, delicious, and the perfect ending to the weekend.

Reserve on Resy. Book a booth if available.

Estimated dinner: $100–160/pp with wine.

SOBEWFF pacing: Eat small portions of many things. Drink water between tastings. Wear comfortable shoes — the Grand Tasting Village is on sand. Arrive when it opens to beat the lines.
