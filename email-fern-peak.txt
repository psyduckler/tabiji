Here's what we built for you:

Day 1 (May 27) — Arrive & Get Your Seattle Bearings
Pike Place Market in the afternoon (watch the fish throwers, eat dungeness crab, grab a piroshky), then walk the renovated waterfront to Olympic Sculpture Park at golden hour. Dinner in Capitol Hill.

Day 2 (May 28) — Discovery Park Loop & Ballard Locks
Seattle's largest city park: 2.8-mile loop trail through Douglas fir forest, down to the West Point Lighthouse, harbor seals on the beach, Mount Rainier in the distance. Lunch in Ballard at The Walrus and the Carpenter (oysters at their May peak). Then the Ballard Locks — watch boats navigate between Puget Sound and Lake Union, and catch the steelhead running through the fish ladder viewing windows.

Day 3 (May 29) — Kayaking Lake Union & the Ship Canal
Rent kayaks from Northwest Outdoor Center on Lake Union. Paddle past the houseboat community, through the Ship Canal past the Fremont Troll (beach your kayak and walk up), watch seaplanes take off overhead. This is Seattle from the water — the only way to truly see it. Lunch in Fremont, evening in Capitol Hill.

Day 4 (May 30) — Bainbridge Island Ferry
Morning ferry from Colman Dock (35 minutes across Puget Sound — stand on the upper deck, Mount Rainier to the south, Olympics ahead). Explore Winslow, hike Fort Ward State Park's coastal forest trails to rocky beaches with harbor seals. Lunch at Hitchcock restaurant. Return ferry at golden hour with the Seattle skyline lit up ahead of you.

Day 5 (May 31) — Rattlesnake Ledge Hike
Drive 45 minutes east on I-90 into the Cascades. Hike Rattlesnake Ledge: 4 miles round trip, 1,100 feet of elevation gain, views over Rattlesnake Lake with snow-capped peaks. For fewer crowds and better views, continue 15 minutes to Middle Ledge. Lunch in North Bend at Twede's Cafe (the Twin Peaks "Double R Diner" — cherry pie required). Then back to SEA for your flight.

A few practical things:
- Arrive at Rattlesnake Ledge trailhead by 7:30am on Sunday — parking fills fast
- You'll need a Washington Discover Pass for the hike ($11.50, get it at discoverpass.wa.gov)
- Book Matt's in the Market and Poppy in advance — they fill weeks ahead for groups of 4
- The Bainbridge ferry runs hourly, no reservations needed for walk-ons
