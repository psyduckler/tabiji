Cairo After Hours: Pharaohs, Bazaars & Nile Nights
4 days solo | May 21-24, 2026

The big idea: Cairo in May is ruthless heat by day and electric energy by night. This itinerary is built around that reality -- outdoors before 11am, rest during peak heat, then the city opens back up at dusk and doesn't stop until 3am.

---

DAY 1 (Thu May 21): Dawn at the Plateau

7:00am -- Pyramids of Giza (arrive at opening bell, golden light, manageable heat)
10:30am -- Grand Egyptian Museum next door (fully open since Nov 2025 -- Tutankhamun's full collection, world's best archaeology museum, air-conditioned refuge)
2:00pm -- Hotel rest (non-negotiable in May)
8:00pm -- Dinner at Abu El Sid, Zamalek (upscale traditional Egyptian -- molokhia, kofta, fattah)
10:00pm -- Crimson Bar & Grill rooftop (Zamalek, Nile views, proper cocktails)

DAY 2 (Fri May 22): Islamic Cairo & Khan el-Khalili

7:30am -- Citadel of Saladin + Mohamed Ali Mosque (views over all of Cairo, opens early)
9:30am -- Al-Muizz Street (pedestrian open-air museum, 1000 years of Islamic architecture)
12:30pm -- Koshari at Abou Tarek, Downtown (Egypt's national dish, legendary institution, $1.50)
5:00pm -- Khan el-Khalili bazaar (14th-century souk, copper work, spices, lanterns -- haggle hard)
7:30pm -- El Fishawy cafe (mint tea + shisha, 200+ years open 24/7, inside the bazaar)
9:00pm -- Shawarma walk on Talaat Harb Street
10:30pm -- Cairo Jazz Club (best live music venue, local crowd, Agouza)

DAY 3 (Sat May 23): Egyptian Museum & Tanoura Night

9:00am -- Egyptian Museum on Tahrir Square (the 1902 original -- Royal Mummy Room essential, extra $10)
7:30pm -- Dinner at Sequoia (Nile terrace at northern tip of Zamalek, felucca boats, grilled fish)
9:30pm -- Tanoura show at Wekalet el-Ghouri (Saturday night! Sufi whirling in a 15th-century courtyard, free, genuinely unforgettable -- arrive 20 min early)
11:00pm -- Rooftop bar at Nile Zamalek Hotel (best sweeping Nile views, very local, very cheap)

DAY 4 (Sun May 24): Coptic Cairo & Farewell Koshari

8:00am -- Coptic Cairo (Hanging Church, Ben Ezra Synagogue, Coptic Museum -- oldest Christian neighborhood in Egypt, quiet and meditative)
11:00am -- Final Khan el-Khalili pass for souvenirs if needed
12:30pm -- Final koshari at Abou Tarek (the only correct last meal)
Afternoon -- Airport (allow 2.5-3 hours before flight)

---

BUDGET: ~$700-1,150 total (excluding flights)
Cairo is exceptional value. Hotels in Zamalek run $100-180/night for mid-range. Site entry for everything is under $80 total. Meals range from $1.50 (koshari) to $35 (upscale dinner). Uber everywhere is $3-6 per ride.

KEY TIPS:
- Buy Pyramids + GEM tickets in advance at egy.tickets.gov.eg (GEM can sell out)
- Get a local SIM at the airport (Vodafone/Orange, ~$6 for unlimited data)
- "La shukran" (no thank you) + walking away handles all touts
- At Khan el-Khalili, open with 25-30% of asking price
- Cover shoulders and knees for mosques and churches (light scarf in your bag)
