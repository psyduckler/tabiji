TRIP OVERVIEW
--------------
Destination: El Calafate, Argentine Patagonia
Dates: July 2-5, 2026 (4 days / 3 nights)
Group: 2 travelers
Style: Adventure + Relaxation

July is a special time in Patagonia. The tourists are gone, the glacier is draped in fresh snow, the skies are dramatic, and you have the walkways largely to yourselves. Here's what the four days look like:

DAY 1 - ARRIVE & FLAMINGOS
Land in El Calafate (FTE), check into your hotel, and walk to Laguna Nimez Nature Reserve -- a shallow lake right in town where hundreds of Andean flamingos overwinter with the snowy Andes as their backdrop. Dinner at La Zaina, the best restaurant in El Calafate, with their legendary Patagonian lamb for two.

DAY 2 - PERITO MORENO GLACIER
The full glacier day. Take the morning tour bus to Los Glaciares National Park and spend the day on the walkway network facing the glacier's towering ice wall. In July, calving events thunder across an almost-empty amphitheater. Lunch at Resto del Glaciar right at the ice face. Optional: nautical safari by boat at the base of the glacier. Afternoon stop at the Glaciarium ice museum + Yeti Ice Bar (a -10C bar carved from ice, with Patagonian spirits). Dinner at Casimiro Bigua Parrilla.

DAY 3 - SNOWSHOES & ESTANCIA
Morning snowshoeing through lenga beech forest at Calafate Mountain Park -- condors circle the thermals above. Afternoon at Estancia Nibepo Aike, a working Patagonian sheep ranch inside the national park. Horseback riding through the steppe, then the full asado experience: a whole lamb slow-roasted on an iron cross over an open wood fire. This is the meal you'll tell people about.

DAY 4 - LAGO ARGENTINO MORNING & DEPARTURE
A slow morning walk along the shoreline of Lago Argentino (largest lake in Argentina) watching the Andes light up, a final coffee and medialunas at Panederia Don Luis, a souvenir stop for calafate berry jam, then taxi to FTE for your afternoon flight home.

A FEW THINGS TO KNOW FOR JULY
- Pack real winter gear: merino base layers, insulating mid-layer, waterproof hard shell, waterproof boots with grip, gloves, wool hat
- Ice trekking on the glacier (Big Ice / Mini Trek) runs Sep-Apr only -- not available in July. But the walkways and boat tours are fully open.
- Bring USD cash in good condition. The informal exchange rate (blue rate) gives you 30-50% more than ATM rates.
- Sunrise around 9am, sunset around 5:30pm. Get to the glacier by 10am to maximize your daylight.
- Book glacier transport and the estancia through agencies on Avenida del Libertador once you arrive -- often cheaper in person than pre-booking online.
