Here's what we put together for your Feb 26 - Mar 1 trip for two:

DAY 1 (Feb 26): Arrive, explore Congress Avenue & the Texas State Capitol, dinner at Matt's El Rancho (Tex-Mex since 1952), then live music at the legendary Continental Club on SoCo.

DAY 2 (Feb 27): Museum day -- the Blanton Museum of Art (don't miss the Ellsworth Kelly chapel), the Bullock Texas State History Museum, then an afternoon strolling South Congress for galleries, boutiques, and street art. Evening at C-Boy's Heart & Soul for blues and dancing.

DAY 3 (Feb 28): East Austin's street art and galleries, world-class BBQ at la Barbecue, the Contemporary Austin at Laguna Gloria (a stunning lakeside sculpture park), Rainey Street's historic bungalow bars, dinner at Emmer & Rye, then a big music night at Antone's or two-stepping at The White Horse.

DAY 4 (Mar 1): The LBJ Presidential Library (free and genuinely incredible), a walk along Lady Bird Lake, and a farewell lunch at Guero's Taco Bar before heading to the airport.

Late February is a beautiful time for Austin -- expect pleasant 65-72F days, cool evenings, and maybe even some early Texas wildflowers. The itinerary has all the details: maps, restaurant tips, Reddit recommendations, and a budget breakdown.

Have an amazing trip!
