Hi Thomas,

Your Shanghai itinerary is ready. Welcome back to tabiji — this one is a big step up from Beijing.

Here it is:

4 days, March 24-27, 2026. Here's what's packed in:

DAY 1 — The Bund & Pudong
Walk the 1.5 km waterfront promenade at The Bund, cross to Pudong on the local ferry (¥2), ride the world's fastest elevators to the 118th floor of Shanghai Tower, then return for The Bund at night as the city lights up across the Huangpu River. Dinner at Mr & Mrs Bund — Paul Pairet's Michelin-starred French restaurant on the 6th floor of Bund 18, overlooking the skyline. The 72-hour braised rib and the lemon tart are what everyone comes back for.

DAY 2 — Old Shanghai (Yu Garden, Tianzifang, French Concession)
Ming dynasty pavilions at Yu Garden (arrive at opening — weekday mornings are quiet), soup dumplings at Nanxiang Steamed Bun Restaurant (operating since 1900), restored shikumen alleyways at Xintiandi and Tianzifang, then an afternoon wander through the French Concession's tree-lined lanes and Wukang Mansion. Dinner at Fu He Hui — 2 Michelin stars, Zen Buddhist vegetarian, one of the most unusual and extraordinary restaurants in China. Ask for the off-menu mapo tofu.

DAY 3 — French Concession Deep Dive & Jing'an
Morning in Fuxing Park with the tai chi practitioners, then into the villa streets and the Propaganda Poster Art Centre (a hidden gem in a residential basement — 3,000 original Maoist posters from 1950-1985, genuinely strange and beautiful). Afternoon at Jade Buddha Temple, where monks chant at 3pm and the white jade Buddha is worth the trip alone. Dinner at Ultraviolet by Paul Pairet — 3 Michelin stars, 10 seats, one table, a secret location, 22 courses, and a room that transforms around you. It's the most ambitious restaurant in Asia. Book now at uvbypp.cc — it fills 2-4 months out.

One note on Ultraviolet: it runs about $660/person including beverage pairing, which pushes the overall budget slightly above $1k. If you want to stay under, the itinerary includes 8½ Otto e Mezzo Bombana (3 Michelin stars, Italian) as an alternative at around $150. Either way, Night 1 (Mr & Mrs Bund) and Night 2 (Fu He Hui) together are worth the trip on their own.

DAY 4 — Zhujiajiao Water Town
An hour from Shanghai by Metro Line 17 or tourist bus, Zhujiajiao has been threading canals through stone alleyways since the Tang dynasty. Thirty-six stone bridges, a 1341 Buddhist monastery, a 700-year-old ginkgo tree, braised pork belly sold from terracotta pots on the canal bank. Go early, explore the north bank streets away from the tourist strip, take a gondola ride. Back in Shanghai by late afternoon.

A few things worth booking before you land:
- Ultraviolet: uvbypp.cc — book now, it fills fast
- Fu He Hui: +86-21-3980-9188 or their website — 1-2 weeks ahead
- Mr & Mrs Bund: mmbund.com — 2-3 days is fine
- VPN: Install Astrill or ExpressVPN before you leave — can't download them in China
- Alipay: Set up with your foreign card before arrival

The itinerary has a full budget breakdown, practical tips (metro card, navigation apps, visa-free entry rules), and hotel recommendations in the French Concession and Jing'an.

Hope Shanghai treats you well. It's a different city from Beijing in every way — messier, more cosmopolitan, more electric. Enjoy every layer of it.
