Here's what's in store for June 19-22:

Day 1 (Jun 19): Arrive in Banff, Bow Falls, Surprise Corner, and the Tunnel Mountain hike for a sunset panorama over the Bow Valley.

Day 2 (Jun 20): The big one — Moraine Lake at sunrise (the turquoise lake on Canada's old $20 bill), then Lake Louise and the Lake Agnes Tea House hike. End the day soaking in the Banff Upper Hot Springs.

Day 3 (Jun 21): Johnston Canyon's catwalk trail through a glacier-carved gorge, then the Icefields Parkway drive north with stops at Bow Lake, Peyto Lake (arguably the best viewpoint in the Rockies), and Mistaya Canyon.

Day 4 (Jun 22): Summit Sulphur Mountain (hike up or take the gondola), a farewell brunch, then the drive back to Calgary.

A few things to do now:
- Book the Moraine Lake shuttle at reservation.pc.gc.ca — they sell out weeks in advance
- Book your accommodation in Banff town (fills up fast in June)
- Get your Parks Canada pass (daily or annual Discovery Pass)

Full details, tips, and restaurant recommendations are all in your itinerary.

Safe travels,
