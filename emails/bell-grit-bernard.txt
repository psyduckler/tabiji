Hey Bernard,

Your Philadelphia itinerary is ready.

Here's what's packed into your 4 days (Oct 22-25):

DAY 1 — Old City: Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, Elfreth's Alley
The oldest continuously inhabited street in America. Standing in the room where the Declaration of Independence was signed hits differently in person. Dinner at High Street Philly (James Beard-nominated), nightcap at McGillin's Olde Ale House — open since 1860.

DAY 2 — Art & Terror: PMA, Barnes Foundation, Magic Gardens, ESP
Rocky Steps in the morning (yes, do it anyway), then the Barnes Foundation — 180 Renoirs, the world's largest Cézanne collection, all hung floor-to-ceiling in a way that'll blow your mind. Lunch at DiNic's in Reading Terminal Market (best sandwich in America, per Food Network). The evening: Eastern State Penitentiary's Terror Behind the Walls Halloween event. Book tickets NOW at easternstate.org — Friday nights sell out completely. This is a bucket list experience.

DAY 3 — Wissahickon & Fishtown: Gorge hike, cheesesteak, creative neighborhood
Wissahickon Valley Park is a 1,800-acre old-growth gorge 20 minutes from Center City that most visitors never find. Peak fall foliage in late October. The Forbidden Drive trail runs 5.5 miles along a creek through towering hemlocks. Have brunch at Valley Green Inn (200-year-old inn on the creek). Then: Dalessandro's cheesesteak in Roxborough — locals consider this top 2-3 in the city. Order with Whiz. Evening in Fishtown: dinner at Suraya (Lebanese, exceptional), drinks at Wm. Mulherin's Sons (converted 1800s whiskey house, brilliant bar).

DAY 4 — South Philly & Out: Italian Market, murals, Rittenhouse Square
9th Street Italian Market — oldest outdoor urban market in the US, running since the 1890s. DiBruno Bros for cheese, Isgro Pastries for cannoli (cash only, go early). Walk the Mural Arts murals through South Philly (4,000+ murals in the city). Brunch at Talula's Garden, then SEPTA Airport Line directly to PHL ($8, 25 minutes, no traffic stress).

One thing: book Eastern State Penitentiary tickets before you do anything else. easternstate.org/terror — Friday Oct 23 will sell out. It's worth every penny.

Philly's going to surprise you.
