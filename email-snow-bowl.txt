Here's a quick look at what's inside:

Day 1 (Jan 21): Arrival & First Tracks
- Warm up on Golden Peak / Game Creek Bowl (shorter lift lines, great intermediate terrain)
- Après at Garfinkel's (Garf's) — the classic Vail deck with mountain views
- Dinner at Sweet Basil — the caviar-topped lobster donut is a must

Day 2 (Jan 22): The Back Bowls
- Hit China Bowl, Sun Down Bowl & Tea Cup Bowl for Vail's legendary open-bowl skiing
- Lunch at The 10th (on-mountain table service with panoramic views)
- Afternoon: Blue Sky Basin tree runs — Iron Mask glades if you're feeling bold
- Wine window après at Tavernetta / Four Seasons
- Dinner at Tavernetta — the rigatoni with lamb ragù is extraordinary

Day 3 (Jan 23): Spa Day & Sleigh Ride
- Breakfast at The Little Diner (green chile burritos — a Vail tradition)
- Couples spa treatment at Four Seasons Vail (Alpine Stone Massage — built for skiers)
- Afternoon laps on Northwoods Express
- Evening: Horse-drawn sleigh ride to Bearcat Cabin for a 4-course mountain dinner under the stars

Day 4 (Jan 24): Final Laps & Departure
- Last morning laps — your call (Back Bowls one more time, or mellow groomer farewell)
- Farewell brunch at Root & Flower on Bridge Street
- Head to Eagle County (EGE) or Denver

A few things worth booking ahead before you go:
- Lift tickets: buy online — walk-up prices are steep ($200+/day)
- Sweet Basil & Tavernetta: both fill up fast in January — reserve now
- Sleigh ride dinner at Bearcat Cabin: sells out weeks in advance — book immediately
- Spa at Four Seasons: 2-3 weeks ahead for couples treatment in peak season

January is Vail at its finest — deep snowpack, cold dry powder, and the Back Bowls wide open. Enjoy every turn.

Safe travels,
