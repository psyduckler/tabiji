Here's what's packed inside:

Day 1 (Thu Jan 21) — Arrive & First Turns
Afternoon warm-up laps on the front side (Born Free, Riva Ridge), then legendary après ski at the Red Lion, and dinner at Mountain Standard — wood-fired, hearty, and perfectly Vail.

Day 2 (Fri Jan 22) — Frontside & Back Bowls
First tracks on the groomers, a detour through the hidden Game Creek Bowl, lunch at Two Elk Lodge (11,570 ft, incredible views), and then into Vail's legendary Back Bowls — China Bowl, Sun Down Bowl, Sun Up Bowl — where January powder lives. Dinner at the iconic Sweet Basil (since 1977).

Day 3 (Sat Jan 23) — Blue Sky Basin & Spa Day
Escape the Saturday crowds in Blue Sky Basin (645 acres of wild terrain, Champagne Glade tree skiing, Earl's Bowl). Lunch at Belle's Camp BBQ mid-mountain. Afternoon spa recovery at the Four Seasons or Vail Mountain Lodge. Dinner at Matsuhisa — Nobu's Vail outpost, and one of the best meals you'll have anywhere.

Day 4 (Sun Jan 24) — Last Laps & Farewell
Sunday morning is quieter — take advantage. Final cruise down Riva Ridge, brunch at Alpenrose (Austrian classics since 1973), grab cookies at Covered Bridge, and head out.

A few key tips:
- Book lift tickets online in advance — walk-up prices hurt
- January at Vail is peak season: book lodging and restaurant reservations ASAP
- Sweet Basil and Matsuhisa fill up weeks out — put those on your calendar now
- Flying into Eagle (EGE) instead of Denver saves 4 hours of round-trip driving

Have an incredible trip. Powder days await.
