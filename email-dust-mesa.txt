- Late March weather is perfect: 75-82F, sunny, dry
- Buy your White Sands pass online in advance ($25 at recreation.gov)
- El Paso food is NOT Tex-Mex (locals will correct you) - it's Chihuahuan-style Mexican and it's incredible
- Budget: $580-915 total (excluding flights) - one of the best value destinations in America

Have an amazing trip! El Paso is one of those cities that surprises everyone who visits.
